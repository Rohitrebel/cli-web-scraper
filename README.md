## Times of India Headline Web Scraper

This Python script scrapes the latest headlines from the [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/) homepage and saves them into a timestamped text file. Ideal for those who want a quick snapshot of daily news without visiting the website.

---

## Features

- Fetches and stores headlines in a `.txt` file named after the current date.
- User-defined limit for the number of headlines to fetch.
- Simple and minimal terminal interface.
- Uses `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping and `requests` for HTTP handling.
- Gracefully handles exceptions and user interruptions (CTRL+C).

---

## How It Works

1. Prompts the user to specify how many headlines to fetch.
2. Scrapes the homepage for `<figcaption>` tags, where headlines are located.
3. Saves the headlines to a local `.txt` file.
4. Delays between fetches using `time.sleep(1)` to avoid overwhelming the server.
